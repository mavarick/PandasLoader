Notes
-----
1, if nrows are set, pd.read_csv just read certain rows, which could save a lot of time
2, use iconv to convert the file to utf8 before loading the data
3, always use array methods to transform data, not element-level methods


Problems
--------
1, nan with type: type<'float'>, and if ser =Series[nan, NaN], you should use ser.fillna(val)
twice to fill the na value totally!
